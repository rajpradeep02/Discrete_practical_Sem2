"""1. Create A Class SET. Create Member Functions To Perform The Following SET Operations:
    1) Is Member: Check Whether An Element Belongs To The Set Or Not And Return
    Value As True/False.
    2) Powerset: List All The Elements Of The Power Set Of A Set .
    3) Subset: Check Whether One Set Is A Subset Of The Other Or Not.
    4) Union And Intersection Of Two Sets.
    5) Complement: Assume Universal Set As Per The Input Elements From The User.
    6) Set Difference And Symmetric Difference Between Two Sets.
    7) Cartesian Product Of Sets.
Write A _Menu Driven Program To Perform The Above Functions On An Instance Of The SET Class."""
"""2. Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include
member functions to check if the relation is Reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric, 
Transitive. Using these functions check whether the given relation is: Equivalence or Partial Order relation or None"""
"""3. Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of Set, with or 
without repetition."""
"""4. For any number n, write a program to list all the solutions of the equation x1 + x2 + 
x3 + ...+ xn = C, where C is a constant (C<=10) and x1, x2,x3,...,xn are non-negative 
integers, using brute force strategy."""
"""5. Write a Program to evaluate a polynomial function. (For example store f(x) = 4n2 + 
2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, compute the value of f(n))."""
"""6. Write a Program to check if a given graph is a complete graph. Represent the 
graph using the Adjacency Matrix representation."""
"""7. Write a Program to check if a given graph is a complete graph. Represent the 
graph using the Adjacency List representation."""
"""8. Write a Program to accept a directed graph G and compute the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex."""
